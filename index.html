    <h3 id="goal"> MY GOAL
</h3>
    <h4>I want to build my own voip system, that functions not just how the old PBX's work, but is more user-friendly that will enable anyone to use wherever they are. This sounds like it has been implemented already but the difference is you can use any platform you want, a third party phone application, a browser, a traditional analog phone, a digital phone, a voip phone, a third party analog telephone adapter, and third party cordless phones. The main idea here is that my system will allow third party applications/devices to be used, regardless of what type of signalling it use. </h4>
    <h4>
As of now, I do understand that I lack sufficient knowledge, but I am enforcing what I know and learning what I do not. In the near future, I would be able to create a simple version of what I have in mind, but will continue to strive and do my best to get near of what I am envisioning.
    </h4>
    <h4>
To be able to take my plan in action, it involves reading a lot of books, watching educational videos and getting hands-on experience related but not limited to linux system, database, storage, servers, programming, and voip systems. I know this sounds so much but doing small steps will eventaully take me near to my goal.
